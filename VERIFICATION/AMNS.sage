## This file describes class definitions for new sage mathematical structures :
## An AMNS can be described as a set of polynomials used to represent elements
## of Z/pZ where p is a prime number. The set of polynomials and methods used to generate
## such a set are implemented as the AMNS class. In addition it is meant to manipulate elements
## within the Montgomery domain, where polynomials represent elements of the shape a*phi mod p.
## AMNS polynomial elements are implemented as the AMNS_elt object.
## The implementation takes advantage of sage parent/element framework such that
## AMNS elements can be manipulated easily and are compatible with a large number
## of functions manipulating polynomials/ring elements.
##
## This implementation is meant to be a functionnal tool but it is expected the mathematical
## framework of sage combined with the algorithmic advantages of AMNS could lead to better
## performance of modular arithmetic operations (granted it is integrated well with the rest of sage).
#########################################################################################


## AMNS class inherits attributes and methods from polynomial ring object PolynomialRing_general.
## It also inherits from the UniqueRepresentation structure, which makes it so two AMNS structure only evaluate
## to equal if they are exactly identical.
from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring import PolynomialRing_general
from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation

## AMNS_elt class inherits attributes and methods from polynomial object Polynomial_generic_dense.
from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element import Polynomial_generic_dense

## The Element structure is used to determine whether the element passed to the constructor of AMNS elements are
## themselves elements of a ring.
from sage.structure.element import Element



## A number of polynomials used within the system are not objects of the AMNS element class :
## Multiplication in an AMNS is achieved through the Montgomery-like algorithm. All polynomials
## involved in this algorithm must be treated as classical polynomial objects (A*B <=> mgt_mul(A, B))
## This includes internal reduction polynomial parameters M and M_P, external reduction parameter E, 
## and operands which are systematically converted to classical polynomial objects for
## each multiplication. The global variable PolyRing represents the ring of classical polynomial objects.
PolyRing = PolynomialRing(ZZ, name = "x", sparse = False)


## If neither LAMBDA nor GAMMA are provided to the constructor of the AMNS object, the constructor attemps to
## build an optimal AMNS with minimal coefficient size for LAMBDA candidate parameters in range LAMBDA_begin to
## LAMBDA_end. the default value of these arguments are given below.
default_LAMBDA_begin = -11
default_LAMBDA_end = 11


###############################################################################################################################################
## The AMNS_elt class for AMNS_element. AMNS elements are polynomials whose degree is strictly less than N 
## and whose coefficients have an absolute value less than rho. when two AMNS polynomials are multiplied 
## together, the degree of the result must be decreased using the external reduction operation mod E.
## The internal reduction operation then ensures that the coefficient values are less than rho.
## Both of these operations are combined in the Montgomery-like multiplication algorithm
##
## The AMNS_elt class inherits from the Polynomial_generic_dense class which means it can be manipulated
## using all of the functions which can manipulate classical polynomials.
## All elements have knowledge of their parent AMNS and can access its parameters and methods, including its
## specific montgomery multiplication method.
##
## init operation is left unchanged. Initialisation polynomial is preprocessed through the _element_constructor_ method
## of the AMNS parent class which operates conversions and ensures polynomials belong to the AMNS
##
## Sage coercion framework and conversions means we can assume operands of arithmetic operations are of the AMNS element type.
##
## Multiplication between two AMNS elements is overloaded to invoke their parent montgomery multiplication method.
##
## Addition or substraction between two AMNS elements is overloaded to operate an internal reduction on the result if
##Â its infinity norm is more than phi
##
## Left and right multiplication by a scalar is overloaded such that scalars are converted to Z/pZ elements and then
## to AMNS elements if their absolute value is more than rho. The conversion can involve up to N multiplications by a scalar
## thus a special case is made for scalars of absolute values less than rho, whose multiplication only involve two one multiplication by a scalar.
##
## A conv_out method is provided to evaluate mod p the current element in its parent AMNS GAMMA parameter.
